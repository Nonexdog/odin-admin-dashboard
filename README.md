# (Odin) Admin dogboard

In this project, I will apply what I have learnt in the grid section of the intermediate HTML and CSS course to create a mockup user dashboard. In this project, I will apply the following bits of knowledge:

  - Using grid and its various helpful features
  - Revisit the use of flexbox to create sections
  - Combine grid and flexbox for better control of the layout
  - Make the design responsive by making use of fractional units and other neat functions
  - Give it my own awesome spin as per usual!!
